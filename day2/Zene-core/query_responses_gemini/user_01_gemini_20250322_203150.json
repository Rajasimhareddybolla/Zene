Detection of accidental free fall of a laptop towards the ground which results in the immediate turning off of the hard drive\n3. Detection of the tilt of the smart-phone which results in the rotation of display between portrait and landscape mode\nIn how many of the above actions is the function of accelerometer required?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
