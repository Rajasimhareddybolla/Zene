      "summary": "The question requires evaluating three statements related to the Indian Constitution and the Prevention of Terrorism Act (POTA), 2002. Statement 1 pertains to the Central Government's duty to protect states from internal disturbances, which is rooted in Article 355 of the Constitution. Statement 2 concerns the provision of legal counsel for individuals under preventive detention, which is not explicitly exempted by the Constitution. Statement 3 relates to the admissibility of confessions made to the police under POTA, 2002. The correctness of each statement must be assessed based on constitutional and legal provisions to determine how many are accurate.",
