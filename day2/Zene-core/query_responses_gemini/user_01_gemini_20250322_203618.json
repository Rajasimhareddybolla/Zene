      "summary": "The question asks to evaluate two statements regarding India's groundwater extraction in relation to the United Nations' World Water Development Report 2022 and its necessity to meet the needs of its population. Statement I claims that India extracts more than a quarter of the world's groundwater each year according to the report. Statement II asserts that this extraction is necessary to satisfy the drinking water and sanitation needs of approximately 18% of the world's population residing in India. The solution involves analyzing these statements based on available data and reports to determine their correctness and relationship.",
