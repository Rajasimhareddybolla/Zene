Recently, all the countries of the\nUnited Nations have adopted the\nfirst-ever compact for international\nmigration, the 'Global Compact\nfor Safe, Orderly and Regular\nMigration (GCM)'.\n2. The objectives and commitments.\nstated in the GCM are binding on\nthe UN member countries.\n3. The GCM addresses internal\nmigration or internally displaced\npeople also in its objectives and\ncommitments.\nHow many of the above statements are\ncorrect?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
