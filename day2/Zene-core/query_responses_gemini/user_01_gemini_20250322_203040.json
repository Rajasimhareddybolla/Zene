      "summary": "The question presents two statements regarding the soil in tropical rain forests. Statement I asserts that the soil is rich in nutrients, while Statement II explains that high temperature and moisture cause rapid decomposition of dead organic matter. The solution involves evaluating the accuracy of both statements and determining if Statement II correctly explains Statement I. Based on standard ecological knowledge and supporting content, tropical rainforest soils are generally nutrient-poor, making Statement I incorrect. However, Statement II is correct as the warm, humid conditions in these forests do lead to rapid decomposition. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).",
