  "query": "54. Consider the following actions:\n1. Detection of car crash/collision which results in the deployment of airbags almost instantaneously\n2. Detection of accidental free fall of a laptop towards the ground which results in the immediate turning off of the hard drive\n3. Detection of the tilt of the smart-phone which results in the rotation of display between portrait and landscape mode\nIn how many of the above actions is the function of accelerometer required?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The analysis confirms that all three actions require the function of an accelerometer. In car crash detection, the accelerometer senses rapid deceleration to trigger airbag deployment; in the case of a laptop free fall, it detects the drop and signals the hard drive to shut down to minimize damage; and in smartphones, it monitors tilt changes to adjust the display orientation accordingly.",
