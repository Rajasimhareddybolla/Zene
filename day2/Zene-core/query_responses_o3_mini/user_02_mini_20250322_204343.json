      "summary": "This solution evaluates each statement in relation to the objectives and interventions of Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY). It explains that JSY is a flagship safe motherhood intervention implemented through state health systems under the National Rural Health Mission, aimed at reducing maternal and neonatal mortality by promoting institutional deliveries among poor pregnant women. Statements 2 and 3 are directly in line with these objectives. Statement 4, which claims that JSY provides public health facilities to sick infants up to one year of age, is incorrect. Although Statement 1 refers to JSY as a safe motherhood intervention of the State Health Departments, it is acceptable when considering that the scheme is operationalized at the state level through their health departments. Thus, three out of the four statements are correct.",
