  "query": "53. Consider the following statements:\n1. Carbon fibres are used in the manufacture of components used in automobiles and aircrafts.\n2. Carbon fibres once used cannot be recycled.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2 only\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2",

      "summary": "The solution involves evaluating two statements about carbon fibres. Statement 1, regarding the use of carbon fibres in the manufacture of automobile and aircraft components, is correct based on their widespread application in these sectors. Statement 2, which suggests that carbon fibres cannot be recycled once used, is incorrect because although the recycling process is complex, technologies (such as pyrolysis) do exist to recover carbon fibres. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.",
