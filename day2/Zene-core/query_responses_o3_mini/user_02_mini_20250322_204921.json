  "query": "39. With reference to 'Scheduled Areas' in India, consider the following statements:\n1.  Within a State, the notification of an area as Scheduled Area takes place through an Order of the President.\n2.  The largest administrative unit forming the Scheduled Area is the District and the lowest is the cluster of villages in the Block.\n3.  The Chief Ministers of the concerned States are required to submit annual reports to the Union Home Ministry on the administration of Scheduled Areas in the States.\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "An analysis of the statements regarding Scheduled Areas in India reveals that the notification process as per the constitutional framework is carried out by the President (making Statement 1 correct). However, the second statement incorrectly specifies a fixed administrative hierarchy and the third statement misattributes reporting responsibilities by assigning them to the Chief Minister rather than the Governor. Thus, only Statement 1 is correct.",
