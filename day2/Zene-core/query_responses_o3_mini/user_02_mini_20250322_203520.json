Visakhapatnam: Largest container port in India\nPort\nHow many of the above pairs are correctly matched?\n(a) Only one pair\n(b) Only two pairs\n(c) All three pairs\n(d) None of the pairs",

Pair 1 (Kamarajar Port as the first major port registered as a company) and Pair 2 (Mundra Port as the largest privately owned port in India) are correct. Pair 3 (Visakhapatnam as the largest container port in India) is incorrect since the largest container port in India is actually the Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) in Mumbai.",
