      "summary": "The analysis shows that Statement-I, which claims that India accounts for 3.2% of global export of goods, is factually incorrect as per current data (approximately 2.1% as reported in recent economic surveys). However, Statement-II is correct since many local companies and some foreign companies operating in India have indeed taken advantage of the Production-linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. There is no direct explanatory link between Statement-II and Statement-I. Therefore, the correct answer is that Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct.",
