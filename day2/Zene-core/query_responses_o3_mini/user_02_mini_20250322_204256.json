The Constitution of India exempts\nthe States from providing legal\ncounsel to a person being held for\npreventive detention.\n3. According to the Prevention of\nTerrorism Act, 2002, confession of\nthe accused before the police\ncannot be used as evidence.\nHow many of the above statements are\ncorrect?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The evaluation of the statements is done by analyzing each one in light of constitutional provisions and statutory safeguards. Statement 1 is correct because Article 355 of the Constitution mandates that the Union protects states against external aggression and internal disturbances. Statement 2 is correct since the Constitution, particularly under the preventive detention provisions (Article 22), does not impose a duty on the States to provide legal counsel to a person held under preventive detention. Statement 3 is correct because under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, 2002, as with general legal principles, a confession made by an accused before the police is not admissible as evidence in court.",
