      "summary": "The analysis shows that Statement-I is correct since the World Water Development Report 2022 confirms that India extracts approximately 25% of the world\u2019s groundwater, which is interpreted here as 'more than a quarter'. However, Statement-II is incorrect because attributing the high extraction solely to the drinking water and sanitation needs of 18% of the world\u2019s population is misleading; India\u2019s groundwater is used extensively for irrigation and other purposes as well. Thus, the correct answer is option (c) \u2013 Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect.",
