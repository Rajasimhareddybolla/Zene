Recently, all the countries of the\nUnited Nations have adopted the\nfirst-ever compact for international\nmigration, the 'Global Compact\nfor Safe, Orderly and Regular\nMigration (GCM)'.\n2. The objectives and commitments.\nstated in the GCM are binding on\nthe UN member countries.\n3. The GCM addresses internal\nmigration or internally displaced\npeople also in its objectives and\ncommitments.\nHow many of the above statements are\ncorrect?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",

      "summary": "The evaluation of the three statements concerning the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM) shows that each statement is incorrect. Statement 1 erroneously suggests universal adoption by all UN member states, Statement 2 incorrectly claims the commitments are binding, and Statement 3 wrongly asserts that the Compact addresses internal migration. Therefore, the correct answer is that none of the statements are correct.",
