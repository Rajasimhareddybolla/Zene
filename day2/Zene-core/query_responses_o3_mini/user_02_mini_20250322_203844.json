  "query": "52. Consider the following statements in the context of interventions being undertaken under Anaemia Mukt Bharat Strategy :\n1. It provides prophylactic calcium supplementation for pre-school children, adolescents and pregnant women.\n2. It runs a campaign for delayed cord clamping at the time of child-birth.\n3. It provides for periodic deworming to children and adolescents.\n4. It addresses non-nutritional causes of anaemia in endemic pockets with special focus on malaria, hemoglobinopathies and fluorosis.\nHow many of the statements given above are correct?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four",

      "summary": "The Anaemia Mukt Bharat (AMB) strategy is a multifaceted initiative aimed at reducing anaemia prevalence through several interventions. On analyzing the four statements provided regarding the interventions under AMB, it was found that the first statement is inaccurate because the intervention of calcium supplementation under AMB is primarily targeted toward pregnant (and lactating) women only, not extended to pre\u2010school children and adolescents. The other three statements\u2014delayed cord clamping, periodic deworming for children and adolescents, and addressing non\u2010nutritional causes of anaemia in endemic pockets (including issues like malaria, hemoglobinopathies and fluorosis)\u2014are consistent with the multi-pronged approach of AMB. Hence, only three of the statements are correct.",
