      "summary": "The analysis evaluates two statements about carbon markets. Statement I asserts that carbon markets are likely to be one of the most widespread tools in the fight against climate change, which is supported by their role in incentivizing emissions reductions and promoting sustainable practices. Statement II, which claims that carbon markets transfer resources from the private sector to the State, is a mischaracterization because the mechanism of carbon markets is based on market-driven trading of emission allowances rather than an inherent transfer of resources to the government. Thus, only Statement I is correct.",
