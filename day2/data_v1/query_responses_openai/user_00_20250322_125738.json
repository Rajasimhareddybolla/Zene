Consider the following statements :\nStatement-I:\nIn the post-pandemic recent past, many Central Banks worldwide had carried out interest rate hikes.\nStatement-II:\nCentral Banks generally assume that they have the ability to counteract the rising consumer prices via monetary policy means.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct",

      "summary": "Both statements in the question are factually correct. Statement I notes that many central banks raised interest rates in the post\u2010pandemic period, while Statement II reflects the general belief among central banks that monetary policy tools can control inflation by counteracting rising consumer prices. However, the belief expressed in Statement II is not the direct explanation for why the rate hikes were implemented \u2013 in practice, the hikes were a response to rising inflation and normalization of policy rather than solely relying on an assumption of effectiveness.",
