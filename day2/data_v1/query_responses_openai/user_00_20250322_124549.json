Consider the following statements:\nStatement-I:\nIndia accounts for 3.2% of global export of goods.\nStatement-II:\nMany local companies and some foreign companies operating in India have taken advantage of India's 'Production-linked Incentive' scheme.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation. for Statement-I\n(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct",

      "summary": "The analysis examines two statements: the first about India's share in global exports and the second about the impact of the Production-linked Incentive (PLI) scheme. Based on available data, particularly the reference which indicates that India\u2019s global export share was about 1.7% in 2020 rather than 3.2%, Statement-I is determined to be incorrect. In contrast, many companies, both local and foreign, have indeed availed of the PLI scheme, making Statement-II correct. Consequently, the correct answer is that Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct.",
