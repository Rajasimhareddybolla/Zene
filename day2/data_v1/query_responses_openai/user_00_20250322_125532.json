  "query": "79. Consider the following statements :\n1. In India, the Biodiversity Management Committees are key to the realization of the objectives of the Nagoya Protocol.\n2. The Biodiversity Management Committees have important functions in determining access and benefit sharing, including the power to levy collection fees on the access of biological resources within its jurisdiction.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2 only\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The analysis concludes that statement 1 is correct because Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) play a pivotal role at the local level in implementing the objectives of the Nagoya Protocol by ensuring that local communities benefit from the utilization of their genetic resources and traditional knowledge. However, statement 2 is not correct since there is no clear mandate or supporting evidence that BMCs have been endowed with the power to levy collection fees on biological resources within their jurisdiction. Their primary function is to document biodiversity, facilitate access and benefit sharing (ABS) processes, and serve as a conduit between local communities and external entities.",
