Consider the following statements in respect of the National Flag of India according to the Flag Code of India, 2002:\nStatement-I :\nOne of the standard sizes of the National Flag of India is 600 mm x 400 mm.\nStatement-II:\nThe ratio of the length to the height (width) of the Flag shall be 3:2.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct",

      "summary": "The solution analyzes the two statements regarding the National Flag of India as per the Flag Code of India, 2002. Statement-I claims that one of the standard sizes is 600 mm x 400 mm, but the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) specifies nine standard sizes none of which includes 600 mm x 400 mm. Statement-II states that the ratio of the flag\u2019s length to its height is 3:2, which is correct according to the Flag Code. Thus, Statement-I is incorrect while Statement-II is correct, making option (d) the correct answer.",
