  "query": "36. Consider the following statements:\n1. If the election of the President of India is declared void by the Supreme Court of India, all acts done by him/her in the performance of duties of his/her office of President before the date of decision become invalid.\n2. Election for the post of the President of India can be postponed on the ground that some Legislative Assemblies have been dissolved and elections are yet to take place.\n3. When a Bill is presented to the President of India, the Constitution prescribes time limits within which he/she has to declare his/her assent.\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The detailed analysis shows that none of the three statements are correct. Statement 1 erroneously claims that if the Presidential election is declared void, all acts performed in the exercise of office before the decision become invalid, whereas those acts are generally protected by the doctrine of de facto validity. Statement 2 incorrectly asserts that the Presidential election can be postponed due to the dissolution of some Legislative Assemblies, although the constitutional framework does not permit such postponement. Statement 3 is also incorrect because the Constitution does not prescribe any specific time limits for the President to declare assent on a Bill.",
