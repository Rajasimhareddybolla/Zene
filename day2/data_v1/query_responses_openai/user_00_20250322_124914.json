      "summary": "The problem requires evaluating the matching of sports awards with their respective descriptions. By comparing the actual criteria and purpose of each award with the statement provided in each pair, it is found that Pair 1 and Pair 3 are correctly matched. The Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna Award is correctly described as recognizing spectacular and outstanding performance over a period of four years. The Dronacharya Award is accurately described as honoring eminent coaches who have successfully trained sportspersons or teams. In contrast, the Arjuna Award is meant to recognize consistent outstanding performance and not a lifetime achievement, and the Rashtriya Khel Protsahan Puraskar is awarded for promoting sports (usually to institutions or organizations) rather than honoring contributions made by sportspersons after retirement. Consequently, only two of the four pairs are correctly matched.",
