  "query": "11. Consider the following statements :\nStatement-I:\nIndia, despite having uranium deposits, depends on coal for most of its electricity production.\nStatement-II:\nUranium, enriched to the extent of at least 60%, is required for the production of electricity.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The solution identifies that India heavily relies on coal for electricity production, with coal accounting for around 70% of its total output, despite having uranium deposits that support a small share of nuclear generation. In contrast, nuclear plants use uranium enriched to about 3-5% and not 60% as stated in Statement-II. Thus, Statement-I is correct and Statement-II is incorrect.",
