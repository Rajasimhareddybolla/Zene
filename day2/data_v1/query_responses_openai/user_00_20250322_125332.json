Recently, all the countries of the\nUnited Nations have adopted the\nfirst-ever compact for international\nmigration, the 'Global Compact\nfor Safe, Orderly and Regular\nMigration (GCM)'.\n2. The objectives and commitments.\nstated in the GCM are binding on\nthe UN member countries.\n3. The GCM addresses internal\nmigration or internally displaced\npeople also in its objectives and\ncommitments.\nHow many of the above statements are\ncorrect?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
  "response": {

      "summary": "After a detailed analysis of each statement in the context of the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration (GCM), we find that none of the statements is correct. Statement 1 is false because although the GCM is a significant intergovernmental agreement on international migration, not all UN member states have adopted it. Statement 2 is false as the GCM\u2019s objectives and commitments are non-binding; its provisions are voluntary in nature. Statement 3 is false because the GCM specifically addresses international migration and does not cover internal migration or issues related to internally displaced people.",
