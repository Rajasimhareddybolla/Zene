  "query": "58. Consider the following statements:\n1. Ballistic missiles are jet-propelled at subsonic speeds throughout their flights, while cruise missiles are rocket-powered only in the initial phase of flight.\n2. Agni-V is a medium-range supersonic cruise missile, while BrahMos is a solid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missile.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2 only\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The analysis identifies that both statements provided in the question are incorrect. Ballistic missiles are rocket\u2010propelled and follow a ballistic trajectory that is governed by gravity after the boost phase, rather than being jet\u2010propelled at subsonic speeds. Similarly, cruise missiles are continuously powered by jet engines throughout most of their flight for guidance and precision, not rocket-powered only during the initial phase. Furthermore, Agni-V is an intercontinental ballistic missile powered by solid fuel and not a supersonic cruise missile, while BrahMos is a supersonic cruise missile and not a solid-fuelled intercontinental ballistic missile.",
