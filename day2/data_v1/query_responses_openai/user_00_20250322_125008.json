  "query": "39. With reference to 'Scheduled Areas' in India, consider the following statements:\n1.  Within a State, the notification of an area as Scheduled Area takes place through an Order of the President.\n2.  The largest administrative unit forming the Scheduled Area is the District and the lowest is the cluster of villages in the Block.\n3.  The Chief Ministers of the concerned States are required to submit annual reports to the Union Home Ministry on the administration of Scheduled Areas in the States.\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "This solution evaluates the three statements regarding the administration and notification of Scheduled Areas in India. Statement 1 is correct as the President of India, after consulting the Governor, notifies an area as a Scheduled Area. Statement 2 is incorrect because there is no constitutional or administrative mandate that the largest unit is a District and the smallest is a cluster of villages in a Block. Statement 3 is incorrect because it is the Governor, not the Chief Minister, who is responsible for reporting on the administration of Scheduled Areas.",
