  "query": "42. With reference to ancient India, consider the following statements:\n1.  The concept of Stupa is Buddhist in origin.\n2.  Stupa was generally a repository of relics.\n3.  Stupa was a votive and commemorative structure in Buddhist tradition.\nHow many of the statements given above are correct?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) All three\n(d) None",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The analysis shows that although stupas are central to Buddhist religious tradition as reliquaries and commemorative monuments, their origin is not purely Buddhist. Stupas originated from pre-Buddhist burial mounds in ancient India, which were later transformed by Buddhism, especially under Emperor Ashoka. Therefore, while statements 2 and 3 correctly describe the functions of stupas in the Buddhist tradition, statement 1 is not correct because the concept of stupa predates Buddhism.",
