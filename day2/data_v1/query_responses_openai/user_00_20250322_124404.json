  "query": "21. Consider the following statements:\nStatement-I :\nInterest income from the deposits in Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) distributed to their investors is exempted from tax, but the dividend is taxable.\nStatement-II:\nInvITs are recognized as borrowers under the 'Securitization and Recon- struction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002'.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct",

    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The analysis examines both statements in the light of the actual regulatory and tax provisions related to Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs). Statement I misstates the tax treatment on distributions: in InvITs, the interest income earned on deposit instruments is taxable in the hands of investors (and is not exempt), while dividends distributed were earlier tax\u2010free in the hands of investors (due to the dividend distribution tax paid at the trust level) \u2013 though recent changes have made dividend income taxable. Thus, the way Statement I is framed is incorrect. On the other hand, Statement II asserts that InvITs are recognized as borrowers under the SARFAESI Act, 2002. Owing to the fact that InvITs (when they raise funds through instruments that resemble deposits or borrowings) fall under the operative ambit for enforcement of security interest under the Act, this statement is accepted as correct.",
