      "summary": "The analysis shows that Janani Suraksha Yojana (JSY) is a safe motherhood intervention focused on reducing maternal and neonatal mortality among poor pregnant women by promoting institutional delivery. It is implemented through the state health systems under the National Rural Health Mission. However, providing public health facilities to sick infants up to one year of age is not part of its objectives. Thus, among the four statements, statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct while statement 4 is incorrect.",
