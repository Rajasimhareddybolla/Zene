      "summary": "This solution evaluates two statements related to India's groundwater extraction as per the UN World Water Development Report 2022. Statement-I, which asserts that India extracts more than a quarter of the world\u2019s groundwater withdrawal annually, is supported by the report. In contrast, Statement-II, which claims that this high extraction rate is solely to meet the drinking water and sanitation needs of India's 18% share of the world\u2019s population, is incorrect because India's groundwater use is driven by multiple factors including extensive agricultural irrigation.",
