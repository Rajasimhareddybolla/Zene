The members nominated to either House of the Parliament or the Legislative Assemblies of States are also eligible to be included in the Electoral College.\n2. Higher the number of elective Assembly seats, higher is the value of vote of each MLA of that State.\n3. The value of vote of each MLA of Madhya Pradesh is greater than that of Kerala.\n4. The value of vote of each MLA of Puducherry is higher than that of Arunachal Pradesh because the ratio of total population to total number of elective seats in Puducherry is greater as compared to Arunachal Pradesh.\nHow many of the above statements are correct?\n(a) Only one\n(b) Only two\n(c) Only three\n(d) All four",
