Consider the following statements :\nStatement-I:\nIndia, despite having uranium deposits, depends on coal for most of its electricity production.\nStatement-II:\nUranium, enriched to the extent of at least 60%, is required for the production of electricity.\nWhich one of the following is correct in respect of the above statements?\n(a) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(b) Both Statement-I and Statement-II are correct and Statement-II is not the correct explanation for Statement-I\n(c) Statement-I is correct but Statement-II is incorrect\n(d) Statement-I is incorrect but Statement-II is correct",
  "response": {
    "solution_notes": {
      "summary": "The question assesses the understanding of India's electricity production sources and the enrichment levels required for uranium in nuclear power generation. Statement I is correct as India relies heavily on coal despite having uranium deposits. Statement II is incorrect because electricity production typically requires uranium enriched to about 3-5%, not 60%.",
