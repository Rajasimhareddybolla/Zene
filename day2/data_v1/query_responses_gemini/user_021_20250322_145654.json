The Biodiversity Management Committees have important functions in determining access and benefit sharing, including the power to levy collection fees on the access of biological resources within its jurisdiction.\nWhich of the statements given above is/are correct?\n(a) 1 only\n(b) 2 only\n(c) Both 1 and 2\n(d) Neither 1 nor 2",

      "summary": "The question pertains to the roles and functions of Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) in India, particularly their significance concerning the Nagoya Protocol and their powers in access and benefit sharing. Statement 1 emphasizes the role of BMCs in realizing the objectives of the Nagoya Protocol, while Statement 2 focuses on their functions in determining access and benefit sharing, including the power to levy collection fees. Both statements need to be evaluated based on the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act, 2002, and relevant guidelines.",
